# Friend-Finder

## Description

*Friend Finder* simulates a simple dating application that matches a user with a friend based on the user's responses to a question survey.

*Tools used*
* Javascript
* Node 
* NPM
* Express
* Bootstrap
* Heroku

## Demo

*Friend Finder* is deployed to Heroku. Check it out [here] (https://nameless-lake-64293.herokuapp.com/).

## Installation

To install the application, follow the instructions below: 

        git clone git@github.com:ANRAx/Friend-Finder.git
        cd friend finder
        npm install 

## Running Locally

Running the application locally requries that you first set the `PORT` environment variable to the value of your choice.

After the `PORT` environment variable has been set, run the Node.js application with the following command:

        node server.js

The application will now be running locally on `PORT`. You can then access it locally from your browser at the URL `localhost:<PORT>`.
